# ANALYSIS-OF-PHYSICAL-AND-MENTAL-HEALTH-ISSUES-DUE-TO-EXCESSIVE-SCREEN-TIME-IN-YOUNGSTERS

This project examines the impact of excessive screen time on the physical and mental health of youngsters aged 16-24. Using a dataset collected from 685 students via surveys, statistical analysis and machine learning techniques were applied to identify correlations between screen time and various health issues. Data preprocessing involved cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and feature extraction. A chi-square test was conducted to determine significant relationships between screen usage and health parameters. The study implemented a Random Forest model to predict whether screen time exceeding four hours negatively impacts health, achieving an accuracy of 100%. Results indicated that prolonged screen exposure correlates with issues like headaches, sleep deprivation, back pain, and reduced physical activity. The findings emphasize the importance of balancing digital engagement with healthier lifestyle habits to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive screen use.
